<p>Welcome to the brand-new Web Development Tutorial! Here you'll learn how to create a beautiful website.</p>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is a Web Development Tutorial by <a href="https://projects.techboyg5blog.com/">techboyg5</a>, a project and website lover.</p>
<h2>Why was this created?</h2>
<p>I know that there are many people out in the world who don't know how to code. Or need help.</p>
<p>The most popular resource for web development became Mozilla Developer Network, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>.</p>
<p>The problem was, MDN basically became <em>the</em> resource for learning web development. But I know that people love freedom and choice.</p>
<p>So I came up with a solution to the problem. I made a Web Development Tutorial of my own, which will make learning how to make websites fun and easy.</p>
