<p>You need <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> to be the first thing in every HTML document. This is called the document type declaration, or the DOCTYPE.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>This triggers standards mode in web browsers. Without the DOCTYPE, web browsers would display the page in quirks mode.</p>
<p>Note: You might see some other DOCTYPEs occasionally. Avoid using these DOCTYPEs as they are outdated.</p>
