<p>HTML is the markup language of the Web.</p>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
<p>HTML defines the structure of all pages on the Web. Each webpage is an HTML document.</p>
<p>HTML is not for styling, with CSS used instead. HTML is also not a programming language, with JavaScript used instead.</p>
<h2>What does an HTML document look like?</h2>
<p>Great question! This is the code used on <a href="https://projects.techboyg5blog.com/web-development-tutorial/chapter1/page1.html">this page</a> as of 29 August 2020:</p>
