<h2>Installing Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>It's easy to learn HTML with a text editor, but an editor specifically designed for editing code is recommended. I'd recommend Visual Studio Code, a free and open-source code editor by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Visual Studio Code works on Linux, Windows, and macOS. However, this page specifically focuses on Windows.</p>
<h3>Downloading</h3>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code download page</a>. Click the blue download button to download an installer.</p>
<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>Once the download is finished, you can open the installer manually. If you see a message requesting administrator permissions, please enter the password of an administrator (if asked), then accept the message.</p>
<p>Once Visual Studio Code is done installing, you can close the installer window.</p>
<h2>Setting up a website folder</h2>
<p>Now, create a folder on your computer, where all website files will be stored. Putting it in the root Desktop folder or the root Documents folder is recommended.</p>
<h3>Starting Visual Studio Code in this folder</h3>
<p>Open Visual Studio Code. Drag the folder to the Visual Studio Code window. Visual Studio Code will restart, running inside the newly opened folder.</p>
<h3>Creating your first file</h3>
<p>You're now going to create your first file! Inside Visual Studio Code, right-click the empty list of files. Click "New File", then name the file <code>index.html</code>. This will be the home page of your website.</p>
